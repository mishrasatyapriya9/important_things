### To undo the git init command and remove the Git initialization from your project directory, follow these steps:

# Open a terminal window or command prompt.
# Navigate to your project’s root directory (the directory where you accidentally ran git init).
Delete the .git folder and its contents using the following command:
#### rm -rf .git
If you’re using Windows, you can undo the git init command by running:
#### rmdir /s .git

This command removes the .git directory that was created during initialization. Don’t worry—all your work will still be there after running this command. Just make sure you’re in the correct directory before executing it! 😊👍
